# Focus and Channeling Elements
----

This proposal outlines the process for constructing a spell.

**How do you cast a spell?**

A spell is created over the course of several *focusing* actions, each requiring some amount of Action Points. When the correct combination of elements is achieved, the caster may immediately *evoke* the spell, which performs the listed effect. However, the *number* of elements that may be assembled at one time, the speed in which they are added to the spell, and the risk of failure is subject to the abilities of the character and the circumstances in which the spell is cast.

**How many elements can I focus on at once?**

This is largely determined by your abilties. We'll call the generic term *Focus*.If your *Focus* is, say, 3, you could safely assemble and evoke a spell that contains up to three elements. For spells with more than one instance of an element, each instance counts towards this total (and is used to determine the *type* of spell, as discussed in the section below. Some jobs may increase your focus in specific ways. An example might be the Cindermage giving you an additional two focus, but those two additional spots may only be filled with Fire. A Warlock might be able to increase his focus by surrendering his free will or physically harming himself.

Conversely, effects might *lower* a character's focus. Damage, for example, will quickly reduce a spellcaster's ability to access their more cerebral abilities. Environmental factors may also adversely affect focus; getting caught in a blizzard will likely reduce every caster's focus - except an ice mage, who could actually benefit!

**Is my Focus level a hard limit?**

No. Your Focus represents the amount you can *safely* contain in a spell, but situations may demand a bigger spell. However, when a spell exceeds its caster's Focus, the risk of it going out of control increases quickly and severely. We will call the number of elements in a spell that exceed the caster's focus at any given time the spell's *Overload*.

Whenever a caster *evokes* a spell or ends their Actions for the turn while holding a spell with Overload, they must make a check to contain it. Both the check to maintain the spell, as well as the consequence for failure are impacted by the amount of Overload held. In making the check, Overload is applied as a penalty to the roll. If the roll is failed, then the Overload is used to augment the severity of the consequences for losing control. The next section details what happens when control of a spell is lost.

**Note:** At the time of writing, there is no Hard Cap on how much overload a caster may risk in casting a spell, but this is likely subject to change as playtesting identifies the potential for abuse.

**What happens when I lose control of a spell?**

It's never great.

When a caster loses control of a spell, they must determine the effect of the failure by rolling on the appropriate table for the *type* of spell that failed. If a spell contains only one type of element, or contains more than one instance of an element, than it is considered to be of that element's type. Spells with more than one multiple-instance element are considered to be of both types.

> Example: The spell "Ignite" requires only a single fire element to evoke. However, since it is Only made of fire elements, it's a Fire Spell.

> Example: The spell "Commune" requires one of every type of element. However, since there is only one of each element, it is typeless.

> Example: The spell "Scalding Cloud" requires one air, two water and two fire. Because water and fire both have more than one element in the formula, this spell is both a Fire Spell and a Water Spell.

When you lose control of a spell that is more than one type, the failure table you roll on should be determined randomly from the valid choices. In the "Scalding Cloud" example above, you could flip a coin, as there are two valid types to choose from.

When rolling on a Spell Failure table, you *roll a number of dice equal to the Overload of the spell when it failed.* Thus, the numbers can get quite high when a big spell is disrupted or a novice caster gets to greedy with Overloading. The results on the table range from an innocuous fizzle with no effect to long-term effects on the character, or even instant death.
