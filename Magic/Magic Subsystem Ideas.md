# Magic Subsystem Ideas
----

This is a collection of all the ways in which supernatural power might be generated, metered, controlled or spent in the proposed magic system.

**#1: Elemental Channeling**

The caster spends Action Points to channel core elements like Water and Fire, one at a time. Each element contributes some property to the spell, like increased damage, range, area of effect or secondary effects. While the caster is channeling one or more elements, he is vulnerable to attack; damage can cause the channeling to fail with unintended side effects. When the caster is confident that they have the right combination of elements cast, they finalize the spell and resolve its effect.

*Supplementary Rule:* Some spells can be pre-fabricated, like a fighter's combination maneuvers. These pre-fab spells provide easy out-of-the-box versions of popular spells like Fireball, and are even minorly discounted; however, they cannot be customized on the fly and must be cast as a single Action Point expenditure.

**#2: Demonic Pact-Based Augmentation**

The caster chooses from a pantheon of evil beings to voluntarily be possessed by. In exchange for increased powers and abilities, the caster must satisfy the pact before the evil being abdicates, often by performing specific actions or meeting a threshold of violent ends. This can mean that if combat ends and the pact is not sated the evil being can punish the caster for failing to deliver, or even seize control of the caster and attack his allies or other innocent bystanders.

**#3: Combat Passion-generated Spiritual Summons**

The caster runs into combat and performs actions with the intent of satisfying the conditions to evoke a ghostly version of an animal companion, who appears, does a thing and then vanishes. Alternatively, the caster could simply manifest the animal spirit in some manner of shape-change, deliver an attack native to the creature, and then revert back.

**#4: Pact Debt Spellcasting**

The caster can evoke any number of powerfull spells or abilities, but each time he does a debt is added to an accumulating total. At some point in the future, like after a long rest, the pact payment is due- this can be realized in physical damage, suppression of physical stats, or even death.
