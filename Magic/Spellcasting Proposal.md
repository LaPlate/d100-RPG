# Spellcasting Proposal

February 18th, 2020

## Overview
----

In order to make a system that does not become overly complex while retaining common metrics for balancing power, we need a common ground system for both martial actions and magical ones. This proposal makes use of an **Action Point (AP)** system to accomplish these goals.

## Magic and the Game's Theme
----

The first thing we should identify is that *every* PC should have access to supernatural abilities. This is simply because we believe that heroic roleplay in a fantasy environment cannot hope to maintain balance between specializations when one 'class' can break the laws of physics, and another cannot. 

That said, the challenge falls on us to make every archetype supernatural in familiar-feeling and clever ways. *Anyone* can pick a lock, and even become very good at it- that's not how an archetype should work. But a rogue-like blade who can slip literally into the cracks in the wall, place his hand on a chest and 'hear' the contents inside, and vanish with the stolen goods right under the guards' noses is no less thematically appealing to the burglar-loving player, but gives his archetype something to Do when the mages with their lockpicking spells come calling.

## Standardization on the Maneuver and AP System
----

In order to assist with power parity and customization of magical archetypes, spells should be compartmentalized actions, just like the footwork, feinting, tumbling and lunging in a fighting archetype's AP expenditure that leads up to a clever attack.
