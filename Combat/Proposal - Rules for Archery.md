# Archery Combat Proposal #

**Overview**
----
Archery in tabletop RPGs has had a checkered history. There is little doubt that the invention of the Bow & Arrow revolutionized both large and small scale combats, and you can't really have a fantasy setting without including the countless fantasy archer archetypes. But we can address some of the problems that come from trying to make bows and arrows 'fit' into a tabletop game, and we provide that attempt here.

**The Problem With Arrows**
----
In combat, Archers serve an important role and are thematically a pretty important part of any fantasy world. However, when attempting to place them in a rules construct like a tabletop RPG, we must acknowledge and overcome the following challenges:

* **They are portrayed as lethal in our stories.** Take *The Lord of the Rings* or *The 13th Warrior* archers, and you'll see a common rule- one arrow completely incapacitates its target. The exceptions to this rule are memorable because they run counter to the accepted mechanic; Boromir fights his way through many arrows because he is exceptionally tough and strong. The orc at Helms' Deep fights his way through many arrows because that scene was stupid.

This makes for a serious balancing issue in tabletop RPGs. If a Bow and Arrow deals lethal damage equal to hand weapons, only from the safety of a great distance, how can we hope to balance them?

* **Logistically, they are difficult to include in combats.** Your standard encounter puts the combatants in near close quarters, or at least close enough that combat isn't preceded by several boring rounds of advancing toward each other. The traditional English Longbow could strike targets 75 yards away- that might be *several* entire battlemaps distant in an encounter. What this generally means is that the character with the bow pulls a disproportionate amount of DM effort to challenge; after all, the rest of the party is Right Here. More likely, the DM will ignore the archer completely, who will rain down punishing torrents of damage (see above) from absolute safety.

* **Bows are not portrayed as the finnicky, delicate pieces of equipment that they are.** Traditionally, bows should be unstrung and kept dry. The consistency of the fragile wood they are built with is subject to warping and brittling if they are not kept in fairly protected conditions. But that is not good fantasy. In fantasy stories bows are not subject to breaking and fire just as well in the rain as they do in the shine.

**Rules for Bows & Arrows**
----
The following rules are proposed for archers in combat: 

1. *Bow Classes* - Bows are divided into two classes: Longbow and Shortbow. Shortbows are lower pull, deal less damage and can be fired much quicker. They are designed for skirmishing in combat. Longbows have (often immensely) high draw weights, are physically larger, and fire slowly- but deal much greater damage. These are better suited for large unit tactics (firing into armies)and hunting large game (one shot, one kill importance) or ambushes from distance and concealment.

2. *Aim stat* - One of the difficulties of ranged combat will be a cumulative penalty to score a solid hit based on range. This is countermanded by aiming. Every AP that is spend Aiming reduces the effective range of your bow by the amount of distance listed under the bow's *Aim* stat. Long bows send the arrow out much faster than shortbows, and their aim stat is generally much higher, lending to a greater importance on the first- and possibly only- shot. Shortbows benefit from aiming, but their strength is in mobility and speed, rather than careful shooting.

3. *Destructible Bows and Ruined Shots* - While it's too fiddly to account for weather and proper bow care outside of combat, they should be easy to damage in combat. They are traditionally made of very fragile material, after all. Thus, any player taking the *aim* actions runs the same risk of losing their effort that a spellcaster channeling elements would; incoming damage forces a Composure check to retain the benefits of the aiming so far. Additionally, while aiming, a bow cannot be moved to avoid incoming damage, so strikes to the bow itself would likely destroy it (ruining the shot, naturally). Any archer worth his salt would have a plan for this; simple spells might mend a broken bow or string, some magical bows might 'heal' back together, and some special bows might simply be much, much tougher they ought to be.
