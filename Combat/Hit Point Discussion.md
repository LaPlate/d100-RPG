**Eric:** When you are uninjured, you have hit points that do not track to physical damage, or at least injurious damage. Bruises, nicks, etc.

At this point, the damage heals very quickly. It soaks, more or less; you heal it when you catch your breath. 

Martial characters can fill a healing role here: The cigar chomping NCO tells you to get back in the fight, to keep shooting, keep your head down. 

Gain or recover boxes in your Uninjured tier. 

At Impaired, you have suffered either too much stress or real injury; your mind is shutting down. This maps to real-world situations. You can't think clearly, but your learned reflexes are still functioning. 

In gameplay terms, this means losing concentration of spells, losing the ability to focus on enemy movements or tactics. Fighters begin to lose access to their bags of tricks. 

Maybe you make rolls against your damage in this tier to execute combat tricks or cast spells. 

At Incapacitated, your body is now compromised. You have been seriously injured. It's not fun to just role a death save on your turn, so at this tier you should be able to do dramatic shit; monologue, press the doomsday button, crawl a few feet, etc. You're still in the adventure. 

But you ain't fighting anymore. 

So now you still have plenty of agency on your turn, but you are losing access to the more complicated stuff; that's not as hard to remember, and you're never rendered shit-useless by a bit of bad luck. 

**Jason:** That's a better solution to me.  various levels of damage remove your access to skills/feats/whatever instead of inflicting penalties on you. 

**Shaw:** First thing that comes to mind speaks to the 'is this fun' point, earlier with regard to injury.  I'd suggest that once you hit the impaired track rather than automatically losing access to your abilities, it should instead require some sort of health or willpower check to fight past your injuries in order to do the things you could do at [Uninjured] for free. I.e. to avoid "oh no I've been kicked in the shin, guess I can't cast spells now" 

**Eric:** Oh yeah, definitely.

It's harder to concentrate or do combat tricks, but that's what your training is for. 

**Shaw:** And then you can mess around with the granularity of that with things like high or low pain threshold traits, etc. 

**Eric:** Consider the concept of monsters and encounters. 

Bad guys will always face you at full health, statistically rounding. If you lose permanent access to stuff, you're in a nosedive to defeat. But there might be abilities that allow you to act heroically, even impaired. These should naturally be precious and finite. So if I have to do my heroic recovery or last stand shit, it's time to find a place to sleep. 

**Shaw:** Right.  Like a barbarian character might have a battle rage ability that just outright says 'hey, at injured you don't even have to make checks to act' or a leader character might be able to press on, making their leadership skill check stand in place of other people's check to act despite injury.

**Eric:** A good warlord could give several boxes of 'soak' tier to untrained peasantry because he rallied them to fight. Conversely, a combat medic with a 'you're alright, here's a quick stim/patch/potion' might give someone genuine injury boxes back. 

As for a barbarian, I like the idea of them getting to a bigger and bigger dangerous asshole as they get injured, but they almost lose access to their finesse shit entirely. I'm raging, so at -4 injured boxes I'm at +8 to attack and damage, but at -8 to use my skills. 

**Shaw:** Yeah, where the difference between a warrior and a barbarian is a warrior knows all these tactical abilities and teamwork tricks and the barbarian just puts all their eggs in the Basic Attack basket, but they can do that no matter how injured they are; and the madder they get, the more vicious that basic attack becomes.

**Eric:** Or they gain access to Blood Frenzy skills, that actually increase in their accessibility the farther into Injured he gets. They ain't smart, but they're awesome. Cleaves and Jumps and intimidates oh my. 

**Shaw:** Which also fits nicely into the idea of some hybrid Barbarian/Warlord where they don't know tactics for shit, but you can't kill them and by extension you can't stop them from inspiring their cohorts from fighting on.

**FURTHER DISCUSSION:** Assuming that we use an Action Point system, injury can be used to increase the AP cost of abilities, making fast attackers slow down faster than brutish big-swingers.

**FURTHER DISCUSSION:** To show the loss of mental ability with injury, perhaps the smarter an ability, the harder a check to do it while injured and the fail state is listed right there on the ability?
