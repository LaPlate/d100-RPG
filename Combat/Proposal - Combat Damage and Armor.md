# Combat Damage and Armor Proposal #

**Overview**
----
Combat is the 'crunchiest' part of any rules system, because the function of it is literally Life & Death for the players participating. We want to make it interesting and flexible, but also put a creative mark on the world of tabletop RPGs as a whole by introducing a truly novel - and workable - take on things.

**Assumptions**
----

* Characters make one or more attacks a round with various weapons commonly identified from the fantasy genre, and defend with armor, shields and other items also identified from that same genre.

* Characters receive damage in accordance with the ![Hit Point Proposal](https://github.com/LaPlate/d100-RPG/blob/master/Combat/Hit%20Point%20Proposal.md) located in the repo. Summarily, damage is translated into 'ticked' boxes on the character's Hit Box tracker on their character sheet.

* How an attack is determined to be *valid* is assumed to be detailed elsewhere. For the purposes of this proposal, all attacks discussed have already been determined to be accurate.

**Combat Damage: Numbers vs. Type**
----
When a character inflicts or receives damage, two major factors influence how much damage the attack does. 

The first is the physical strength and effectiveness of the attack. A very strong attacker will hit harder, and a skilled attacker will know how to attack with greater effectiveness. The gameplay result of this metric is *the number of dice rolled*. 

The second is the design of the weapon itself. Skilled martial artists and hugely powerful tavern brawlers both have the potential to inflict major- if not lethal- damage, but there is a high degree of entropy involved. For every punch to the stomach that kills a Houdini there are thousands that mere leave a nasty bruise. However, there is a much greater likelihood of reliable damage from *weapons*, and that certainty grows with how heavy and well-designed that weapon is.

It's important to note here, although we'll cover it in detail below, that heavier weapons have a greater chance of *penetrating armor*. A knife is lethal to an unarmored target. A greataxe is lethal to *everybody*.

The mechanic of weapon type and quality is reflected in the *type of die rolled*. We subvert expectations here a little bit: **The bigger and nastier the weapon, the *smaller* the die you use roll to damage with it**.

*Examples of damage dice by weapon:*

    Damage Die | Example

    d20        | Unarmed punch, Falling Damage
    d12        | Knives, Daggers, improvised weapons
    d10        | Swords, Maces
    d8         | Two-Handed Swords, Mauls
    d6         | Greatswords, Greataxes, Potential Spell Damage
    d4         | Damage rolls for Critical Hits and Special Abilities'


**Penetrating Armor**
----
As we mentioned above, armor is a big factor in reducing damage- that's why we wear it, after all. And how armor reduces damage is largely a function of how much damage *penetrates* it. The likelihood of rigid armor to deflect incoming attacks entirely is covered only in part here, and should be considered in the sections on determining hit or missed attacks. Of prinicpal interest to this proposal, is the concept of *damage reduction*; how much damage is reduced by the armor between the target and the weapon.

We'd like to propose a calculated stat called **Armor Rating**, that starts at 10 and goes down the more protection you have, to a minimum value of 2. It's scarily reminiscent of 2nd Edition D&D, but we do better with it, I promise.

When an attack hits a target, the attacker rolls a number of dice determined by his brawn and skill with the weapon, and uses the type of dice dictated by its type and quality. **Each die that rolls a number Lower than the effective Armor Rating of the target deals one box of injury**. 

Take the following two examples:

> Thorbald is a massive dude and he wishes to punch Lyudmilla. His brawn and brawling skills give him a total of 4 damage dice when attacking barehanded. Lyudmilla is wearing priest's robes, effectively unarmored, so her Armor Rating is 10.
> Thorbald connects with his punch, and rolls the following values on his four d20s: **12**, **6**, **20** and **11**. Not great- he only manages to score One box worth of damage. Lyudmilla draws a Mace, spits out a tooth and grins as she returns the gesture.

>Lyudmilla is also massive, although not to Thorbald's degree; nonetheless, she is rolling three dice. Her mace is traditionally a d10 weapon, but it's been blessed by the barkeep, who is in actuality an ancient Deathless who protects this area from all evil. As a result, it is treated as a d8 weapon. She rolls the following results on her d8s: **1**, **3**, and **7**. Not bad!
>
> Thorbald is wearing studded leather armor, however, and it has lowered his Armor Rating to 7. Therefore, the 7 that Lyudmilla rolled is stopped; but two boxes of injury damage carry through!

**Affecting Damage Dice through Abilities**
----
As a quick note, this system can be altered through character abilities. Traditionally, D&D rogues inflicted damage not through strength or giant weapons, but rather through the clever applications of force during opportune moments and in vulnerable locations. A "sneak attack" with a dagger might roll d6s. A forest hunter might use their aiming actions to reduce the die size from their attack in order to locate a weakness in the armor of the foe they're hunting. Magic spells might be channeled with *puissance* to steadily lower their damage die to crack the armor of the toughest foes- or, conversely, simply be content to roll d10s so long as *there's a whole bunch of them being rolled*. This allows for massive damage to unarmored targets, or concentrated damage to armored ones. The system is surprisingly flexible in that way.
