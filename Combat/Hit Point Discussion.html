            <strong>Eric: </strong>When you are uninjured, you have hit points that do not track to physical damage, or at least injurious damage. Bruises, nicks, etc.

            At this point, the damage heals very quickly. It soaks, more or less; you heal it when you catch your breath. 

            Martial characters can fill a healing role here: The cigar chomping NCO tells you to get back in the fight, to keep shooting, keep your head down. 

            Gain or recover boxes in your Uninjured tier. 

            At Impaired, you have suffered either too much stress or real injury; your mind is shutting down. This maps to real-world situations. You can't think clearly, but your learned reflexes are still functioning. 

            In gameplay terms, this means losing concentration of spells, losing the ability to focus on enemy movements or tactics. Fighters begin to lose access to their bags of tricks. 

            Maybe you make rolls against your damage in this tier to execute combat tricks or cast spells. 

            At Incapacitated, your body is now compromised. You have been seriously injured. It's not fun to just role a death save on your turn, so at this tier you should be able to do dramatic shit; monologue, press the doomsday button, crawl a few feet, etc. You're still in the adventure. 

            But you ain't fighting anymore. 

            So now you still have plenty of agency on your turn, but you are losing access to the more complicated stuff; that's not as hard to remember, and you're never rendered shit-useless by a bit of bad luck.

            <strong>Jason: </strong>that's a better solution to me.  various levels of damage remove your access to skills/feats/whatever instead of inflicting penalties on you.

            <strong>Shaw: </strong>First thing that comes to mind speaks to the 'is this fun' point, earlier with regard to injury.  I'd suggest that once you hit the impaired track rather than automatically losing access to your abilities, it should instead require some sort of health or willpower check to fight past your injuries in order to do the things you could do at [Uninjured] for free. I.e. to avoid "oh no I've been kicked in the shin, guess I can't cast spells now"

            Oh yeah, definitely.<br/>
            It's harder to concentrate or do combat tricks, but that's what your training is for.
