# Discounting through Combinations #
## The Easy way to play this game ##

**Summary**
----
Because one of the purposes of this game is to offer a more complex alternative to the limiting tropes of traditional RPGs, things can be very complicated. Some folks simply may not have time to create a character one trait or skill at a time, and advanced spellcasting might turn away a player who otherwise would have been enthusiastic about playing their favorite wizard. As a result, we want to offer alternatives to deep customization; to reintroduce packages that can easily be played out of the box and are still fun.


**Discounting in Character Creation**
----
We don't want to make folks build characters from scratch if they don't want to, and we also want to make certain that the process is intuitive, with plenty of examples and inspirations to draw from. That said, we want to follow the logical path that *cultures* influence occupations, but they don't limit them (except in extreme cultural outliers).

Each culture will naturally have collections of skills that are encouraged by the value systems of that culture. A good example of this is the natural synergy of traditionally Tolkien-ish elves and bows and arrows, and the logical following synergy of forest-dwelling. Being hidden or inaccessible with a ranged weapon makes perfect sense. Each Culture should produce two or three (at least) archetypal character builds that help tell the story of that culture. When making a character, players can choose to adopt that archetype, and receive the package of benefits (and/or limitations) at a character creation currency *discount*. However- they must take **all** of the properties of that archetype, lumps and all.


**Discounting in Combat Maneuvers**
----
To speed up combat and give players an easier time of playing through the more complicated AP-driven combat system, we can offer incentives to chain actions together in something called *maneuvers*. A good example of this is the classic boxer combo of jab, jab, cross, hook; a combination of strikes so engrained into the muscle memory of a boxer that they can do it extremely fast and with very little concentration. Such maneuvers would be offered with a small AP discount, but with the caveat that they are *all or nothing*- once you commit to a maneuver, you have spent the AP to perform every action in it.

**Discounting in Magic Maneuvers**
----
The magic system is shaping up to be very complicated, and free-form elemental channeling is a lot of work for your average player. To ease this burden and make spellcasting archetypes more accessible to casual players, combinations of elements can (and are, proactively in the source material) be chained together to cast pre-fabricated spells. The drawback to this is the same as maneuvers in martial combat- once you commit to the spell, you've spent the AP *for the whole thing*, and you're in danger of being interrupted with no chance to change or cancel it. Like with maneuvers, pre-fab spells would offer a minor AP discount.
