# Deathless #
The world of Gods and Spirits

**Summary**
----
The term 'Deathless' is a generalism for any animate thing in the world that doesn't perish due to Age (or sometimes even physical destruction). This means that it can refer to pantheons of deific creators as well as simple-minded spirits of nature and even what other systems would call Undead. 

**Feared, Misunderstood, Inaccessible**

The spirits of this world are not simply human minds encased in monster suits, as other game systems frequently default to. They are largely timeless, with unknown or unknowable agendas, and DMs should take every effort to communicate the alien nature of these beings to players. 

Because death is not the inevitable end to a Deathless being, it stands to reason that they would mark time differently, remember things differently and value ephemeral things differently. A tree spirit would have less of a bond with a tree- which only lasts until fire or time destroys it- than a traditional Dryad from popular folklore. Ghosts would be afflicted with Deathless perspective while retaining whatever emotional connection that forced them to remain when they died, creating a sensory perception problem that manifests in terrifying and erratic ways. A spirit drawn to a sword by acts of heroism might not understand the concept of lawful combat versus despicable murder, and serve a new weilder regardless of moral intent.

The mortal races of the world (called the 'Dying people' by Deathless) would be too selfish in their short, needs-driven lives to properly understand these perspectives, leading to culturally perpetuated perceptions of Deathless beings as monstrous, demonic or at the very least sociopathic. Fear and superstition would dominate to varying degrees based on the wisdom of the early people of that culture.
